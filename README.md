# Anchor-Checker-Extension

This project is a Chrome Extension used to help examine links on a particular web page. Basically, it helps you identify relative, absolute, and hash-based URLs.

You start by using the tool to gather all A elements on the current tab. It sorts them into three separate buckets, relative URLs, absolute URLs, and hash URLs. 

After the tool has collected and sorted the links on the page, you can inspect them by applying background styling to the elements on the page. This feature helps you quickly scan pages and determine what kind of links you are working with. Nothing special, but a simple tool that didn't exist already in the Chrome Web Store. 

## Ideas for Future Development 
+ Add a feature to pull out all links inside of a NAV element into a separate bucket 

### Update 01/25/2017
Added addtional functionality to check for mixed case URLs on the page for SEO reasons. All URLs with a capital letter will be painted in orange.
